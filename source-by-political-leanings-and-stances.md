### South Africaâ€™s media landscape, by positioning, ideology, ownership, affiliation.

South Africa's media landscape is diverse and includes a range of print, broadcast, and online media outlets. However, the country's media is also characterized by a high level of concentration and ownership by a small number of large media conglomerates.

In terms of print media, the largest newspapers include the Sunday Times, the City Press, and the Mail & Guardian. These newspapers cover a range of topics, including politics, business, and sports. However, print media has been in decline in recent years, with many newspapers struggling financially and turning to digital platforms to reach audiences.

Broadcast media in South Africa is dominated by the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC), which is a state-owned broadcaster. The SABC operates several television and radio channels and is funded through a combination of government subsidies and advertising revenue. However, the SABC has been criticized for being biased towards the government and the ruling party, the African National Congress (ANC).

There are also several private broadcasters in South Africa, including eNCA, which is a 24-hour news channel. Other notable broadcasters include the SABC's commercial competitors, such as e.tv and M-Net.

Online media in South Africa has seen significant growth in recent years, with many traditional media outlets expanding their digital offerings and several new digital-only publications launching. The largest online news sites include News24, TimesLIVE, and Daily Maverick. Social media platforms are also widely used in the country, with Twitter and Facebook being popular sources of news and information.

However, South Africa's media landscape is not without its challenges. The country's media freedom has been threatened in recent years by attempts to regulate the media and restrict press freedom. There have also been concerns about the safety of journalists, with several high-profile incidents of violence against reporters and editors. Additionally, media ownership remains concentrated in the hands of a few large conglomerates, raising concerns about the potential for media bias and lack of diversity in reporting.
